# LetsLearnTogether-Website

## Overview

Welcome to the Let's Learn Together Website project repository! This is an ongoing project focused on creating a Java-based web application. The project covers essential Git and Linux commands, with a strong emphasis on Spring Boot for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The communication between the frontend and backend is facilitated through REST APIs.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **backend:** This directory contains all the source code for the Spring Boot backend. It includes controllers, services, and repositories necessary for handling backend functionalities.

- **frontend:** The frontend directory houses the React.js components, styles, and other assets. It's responsible for the user interface and interactions.

- **docs:** The documentation directory stores important project-related documents, including guides, specifications, and any relevant information.
